                    <p>I'm a media production, management and technology junior at the University of Florida with a minor in statistics. As a lifelong writer, I plan to use my dual interests in journalism and statistics to tell stories through both words and data. I have experience reporting for student-run and professional news organizations and am currently covering the health beat for The Independent Florida Alligator.</p>

                    <p>After getting my start as a reporter at the University of Florida student-run paper The Independent Florida Alligator, I've interned at professional newsrooms Winter Park Voice and Orlando Weekly. I still work for The Alligator during the academic year, where I most recently took on the first-ever data editor position.</p>

                <p>I also have experience copywriting both in-house and in agencies. I began writing in-house social media and blog copy for Alpha PR, a student-run public relations firm at UF. I then interned as a marketing writer for Mullinax Ford, where I continued developing my blog and "listicle" writing skills. Most recently, I joined The Agency at UF, a full-service communications firm, where I've worked on client teams such as UF Astraeus Space Institute and Chartwells Higher Ed, an on-campus meal provider.</p>
